# ReactNative
The Cryptic app, built using React Native, incorporates an authentication system powered by Firebase. Users have the ability to post pictures anonymously,
which can be viewed in the ’Feed’ section. Additionally, users can express their appreciation for images by
liking them. The pictures with the highest number of likes will be prominently featured at the top of the
feed
